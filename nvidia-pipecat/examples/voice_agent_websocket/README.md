# Speech to Speech Demo with Websocket

In this example, we showcase how to build a simple speech-to-speech voice assistant pipeline using nvidia-pipecat along with pipecat-ai library and deploy for testing. This pipeline uses a Websocket based Websocket Transport, Nemotron Speech ASR and TTS models and NVIDIA LLM Service. We recommend first following [the Pipecat documentation](https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/core-concepts) to understand core concepts.

## Prerequisites and Setup

1. Clone the voice-agent-examples repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/voice-agent-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the example directory:

   ```bash
   cd voice-agent-examples/examples/voice_agent_websocket
   ```

3. Copy and configure the environment file:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env  # and add your credentials
   ```

4. Setup API keys in .env file:

   Ensure you have the required API keys:
   - NVIDIA_API_KEY - Required for accessing NIM ASR, TTS and LLM models

   Refer to [https://build.nvidia.com/](https://build.nvidia.com/) for generating your API keys.

   Edit the .env file to add your keys or export using:

   ```bash
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
   ```

5. Deploy the app using either of the options below.

## Option 1: Deploy Using Docker

### Prerequisites

- You have access and are logged into NVIDIA NGC. For step-by-step instructions, refer to [the NGC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-overview/index.html#registering-activating-ngc-account).
- You have access to an NVIDIA Turing™, NVIDIA Ampere (e.g., A100), NVIDIA Hopper (e.g., H100), NVIDIA Ada (e.g., L40S), or the latest NVIDIA GPU architectures. For more information, refer to [the Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/riva/asr/latest/support-matrix.html).
- You have Docker installed with support for NVIDIA GPUs. For more information, refer to [the Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/riva/asr/latest/support-matrix.html).

### Run

```bash
export NGC_API_KEY=nvapi-... # <insert your key>
docker login nvcr.io
```

From the examples/voice_agent_websocket directory, run below commands:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This will start all the required services. You should see output similar to the following:

![Docker Compose Logs](./images/docker-compose-logs.png)

Docker deployment might take 30-45 minutes first time. Once all services are up and running, visit `http://WORKSTATION_IP:8100/static/index.html` in your browser to start a session. See next sections for detailed instructions on interacting with the app.

## Option 2: Deploy using Python environment

### Requirements

- Python (>=3.12)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

All Python dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and can be installed with `uv`.

### Run

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

Make sure you've configured the `.env` file with your API keys before proceeding.

```bash
python bot.py
```

This will host the static web client along with the voice agent server. Visit `http://localhost:8100/static/index.html` in your browser to start a session.

## Start interacting with the application

![UI Screenshot](./images/ui.png)

Note: For mic access, you will need to update chrome://flags/ and add `http://WORKSTATION_IP:8100` in Insecure origins treated as secure section.

If you want to update the port, make changes in the `uvicorn.run` command in [the bot.py](bot.py) and the `wsUrl` in [the static/index.html](./static/index.html).

## Bot pipeline customizations

### Speculative Speech Processing

Speculative speech processing reduces bot response latency by working directly on Nemotron Speech ASR early interim user transcripts instead of waiting for final transcripts. This feature only works when using Nemotron Speech ASR. Currently set to true.

- Toggle using the environment variable `ENABLE_SPECULATIVE_SPEECH`.
  - Docker Compose: set in `python-app.environment` (default is `true`)

    ```yaml
    environment:
      - ENABLE_SPECULATIVE_SPEECH=${ENABLE_SPECULATIVE_SPEECH:-true}
    ```

  - Local run: export before launching

    ```bash
    export ENABLE_SPECULATIVE_SPEECH=true  # or false
    python bot.py
    ```

- The application will automatically switch processors based on this flag; no code edits needed.
- See the [Documentation on Speculative Speech Processing](../../docs/SPECULATIVE_SPEECH_PROCESSING.md) for more details.

### Switching ASR, LLM, and TTS Models

You can easily customize ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), LLM (Large Language Model), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) services by configuring environment variables. This allows you to switch between NIM cloud-hosted models and locally deployed models.

The following environment variables control the endpoints and models:

- `ASR_SERVER_URL`: Address of the Nemotron Speech ASR (speech-to-text) service (e.g., `localhost:50051` for local, "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443" for [cloud endpoint](https://build.nvidia.com/)).
- `TTS_SERVER_URL`: Address of the Nemotron Speech TTS (text-to-speech) service. (e.g., `localhost:50051` for local, "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443" for [cloud endpoint](https://build.nvidia.com/)).
- `NVIDIA_LLM_URL`: URL for the NVIDIA LLM service. (e.g., `http://<machine-ip>:8000/v1` for local, "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1" for [cloud endpoint](https://build.nvidia.com/))

You can set model, language, and voice using the `ASR_MODEL_NAME`, `TTS_MODEL_NAME`, `NVIDIA_LLM_MODEL`, `ASR_LANGUAGE`, `TTS_LANGUAGE`, and `TTS_VOICE_ID` environment variables.

Update these variables in your Docker Compose configuration to match your deployment and desired models. For more details on available models and configuration options, refer to the [NIM NVIDIA Magpie](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual), [NIM NVIDIA Parakeet](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1_1b-asr/api), and [NIM META Llama](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_1-8b-instruct) documentation.

#### Example: Switching to the Llama 3.3-70B Model

To use larger LLMs like [Llama 3.3-70B model](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/supported-models.html#llama-33-70b-instruct) in your deployment, you need to update both the Docker Compose configuration and the environment variables for your Python application. Follow these steps:

- Check deployment hardware requirements on [NIM Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/supported-models.html#llama-33-70b-instruct)
- Below steps assume 2xH100 for Llama 3.3-70B model and we will need at least 300 GB filesystem memory.
- In your `docker-compose.yml` file, find the `nvidia-llm` service section.
- Change the NIM image to 70B model: `nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:latest`
- Update the `device_ids` to allocate at least two GPUs (for example, `['2', '3']`).
- Update the environment variable under python-app service to `NVIDIA_LLM_MODEL=meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`
- If your deployment is GPU VRAM constrained, you can disable KV cache by setting env variable `NIM_ENABLE_KV_CACHE_REUSE=0`

#### Example: Setting up Zero-shot Magpie Latest Model

1. **Set Up the Docker Image**

   - In your `docker-compose.yml`, set the `tts-service` image to the Zero-Shot Magpie TTS version:

     ```yaml
     image: <magpie-tts-zeroshot-image:version>
     ```

   - Ensure your `NVIDIA_API_KEY` (with zero-shot model access) is correctly set in your `.env` file.

2. **Configuring Zero-shot Audio Prompt**

   To use your own custom voice with zero-shot TTS:

   - Place your desired audio sample in the workspace directory.
   - Mount the audio file into your container by adding a volume in your `docker-compose.yml` under the `python-app` service:

     ```yaml
     services:
       python-app:
         # ... existing code ...
         volumes:
           - ./audio_prompts:/app/audio_prompts
     ```

   - In your `.env` file, set the `ZERO_SHOT_AUDIO_PROMPT` variable to its path (relative to your application's root):
     - `ZERO_SHOT_AUDIO_PROMPT=audio_prompts/voice_sample.wav`  # Path relative to app root

   Note: The zero-shot audio prompt is only required when using the Magpie Zero-shot model. For standard Magpie multilingual models, this configuration should be omitted.

3. **Set TTS Environment Variables**

   In `.env` (for `python-app`), update:

   ```bash
   TTS_VOICE_ID=Magpie-ZeroShot.Female-1
   TTS_MODEL_NAME=magpie_tts_ensemble-Magpie-ZeroShot
   ```
